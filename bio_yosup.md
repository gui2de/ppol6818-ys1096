# Yosup's Bio

## Where I was born and lived ##
I was born in Korea and spent most of my life there,
I lived in Belgium, Oman, Netherlands, and currently USA

## My hobbies ##
I usually spend my free time watching sports like football (or **soccer** for someone) or listening to music

## My policy interest ##
I am currently interested in microfinance and political economcy, and this requires lots of reading and backgroud study. 

Therefore, I am currently reading  about technology and [Bank-performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105752192400632X). which is very interesting article
Recently, I got interested in the impact of microfinance on small business growth using mobile banking and microfinance system. I found its effect was extremly great, but there are many challenges when it comes to implementing the policy. 
Therefore, figuring out the gap between the effect of digitized banking/tech-microfinance and policy implementation is one that i would like to focus on during this summer.
## My vacation plan ##
I am planning to visit ![San Francisco](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c7f5f60797f746a7d769cab/d1466e73-4bff-4821-a7b3-76d688d440e2/the+golden+gate+bridge+san+francisco.jpg?format=2500w) since I have never been to west side yet, and I am very looking forward traveling other states!
